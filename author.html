          Maurice Bernard Sendak (/ˈsɛndæk/; June 10, 1928 – May 8, 2012) was an
          American author and illustrator of children's books. He became most
          widely known for his book Where the Wild Things Are, first published
          in 1963.[2] Born to Polish-Jewish parents, his childhood was affected
          by the death of many of his family members during the Holocaust.
          Sendak also wrote works such as In the Night Kitchen, Outside Over
          There, and illustrated many works by other authors including the
          Little Bear books by Else Holmelund Minarik.
